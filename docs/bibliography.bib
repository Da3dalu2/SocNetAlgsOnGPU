    abstract = {Abstract. Social networks have demonstrated in the last few years to be a powerful and flexible concept useful to represent and analyze data emerging from social interactions and social activities. The study of these networks can thus provide a deeper understanding of many emergent global phenomena. The amount of data available in the form of social networks is growing by the day. This poses many computational chal-lenging problems for their analysis. In fact many analysis tools suitable to analyze small to medium sized networks are inefficient for large social networks. The computation of the betweenness centrality index (BC) is a well established method for network data analysis and it is also important as subroutine in more advanced algorithms, such as the Girvan-Newman method for graph partitioning. In this paper we present a novel approach for the computation of the betweenness centrality, which speeds up considerably Brandes ’ algorithm (the current state of the art) in the context of social networks.
